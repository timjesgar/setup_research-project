  For increased reproducibility, initiate a renv-environment to record package versions.

  To get started:
  1. Open your project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Positron or RStudio).
  2. Run the following to initiate a fresh environment:

     install.packages("renv")
     renv::init()

  3. Now you can `install.packages()` all packages needed for your project.
  4. Whenever you include new packages in your project, don't forget to check if your code is working and save the versions of your packages via `renv::snapshot()`.

  Happy analyzing!
